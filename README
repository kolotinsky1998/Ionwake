This git repository contains C++ OpenMP and MPI parallelized code which solve system of Vlasov equations 
(kinetic equation for ion distribution function and Poisson equation). To solve this system of differential equations the finite difference
scheme is used. Mathematically it is a 6D equation depending on time. The form of the equation can be found here
